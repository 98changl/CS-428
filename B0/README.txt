The game is a two-player shared-screen game where players control a rolling ball inside an enclosed space.

Player 1 (Red) controls:
up	W
down	S
left	A
right	D
jump	Space

Player 2 (Blue) controls:
up	Up Arrow
down	Down Arrow
left	Left Arrow
right	Right Arrow
jump	Right Shift

Each player has multiple single jumps and players will not jump while above ground.
The ball jump is limited in jump height as to avoid jumping the ball over the walls.

The game lasts two minutes and is counted by a 120 second countdown on the center top of the UI.

Collecting a cube increases one point while colliding with a wall reduces one point.
When two players collide with one another, a point will be granted to the player with the greater height.
The player with the lower height will lose a point.

A player's points will not go below zero.

Points are tallied on the top left and top right parts of the UI.
The player points are identified by their color.

There were no extra credit attempts.
